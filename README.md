# Stock Market Analysis

![stock Market](Images/stockmarket.jpg)

Using Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel, I created a script that will loop through large spreadsheets of stock information
and provide the following:
  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

I also added conditional formatting to highlight positive and negative changes for ease of analysis.
